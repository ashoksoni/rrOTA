Adding OPENDELTA_BUILDTYPE (SONI) in builds name so OpenDelta can fetch updates for op2/op3/op3t.
OpenDelta is fixed properly now. We will know for sure once I build my next update. :)

For whoever interested to know the issue.

App checks for the build_type (official or unofficial), it gets disabled if find unofficial build. I made changes in source code so app jumps over the condition
and still checks for updates. This was needed as I build official and unofficial builds now. It wasn't needed earlier.
I am sure there could be other ways to fix this if I knew Java better but for now this works.

Removed:
Shutdown animation, boot/shutdown sounds.
- For testing something, they may come back in future.
3minit Battery Settings apk removed. Download the free app from my AFH/oneplus2/Misc folder.

(Comes with sources update)
Revert "All tile scroller for quickbar settings
Revert "Auto calculate quickbar tiles amount" - Now you can select no. of small qs tiles.
