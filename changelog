Rotation vector fix.(New approach with wrapper)
KCal implementation is much clearer now, Removed not needed commits and it's only few commits now. 
Usb: Gadget: mass_storage: added sysfs entry for cdrom to LUNs (To support DriveDroid properly to switch between USB/CD-ROM)

- Option to ignore slider in zen auto mode.

Bug fixed - Touch Screen playing havoc when hw keys disabled through menu option. Had no impact if the same was done using qs tile.

Bugs yet to squash. (Mostly by CM or RR team)

Certain apps are not visible in "Apps with usage access" but that's Resurrection Remix issue not a local issue as reported in bacon thread too. 
FC in Privacy Guard - That's again not a rom problem as this doesn't happen on clean flash. Use default themes and don't use excessive mods like xposed etc.
 -- I am yet to find the actual coz of this fc but that has to be a reason of a mod or something. Will try to find the coz on a clean install but don't report it though.
