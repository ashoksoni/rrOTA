Latest CM and Resurrection Remix sources synced.
Rotation vector fix.(Next version with wrapper)
KCal implementaiton is much better now, removed not needed commits and it's better now. 
Usb: Gadget: mass_storage: added sysfs entry for cdrom to LUNs (To support DriveDroid properly to switch between USB/CD-ROM)

----
Certain apps are not visible in "Apps with usage access" but that's Resurrection Remix issue not a local issue as reported in bacon thread too. 
FC in Privacy Guard - That's again not a rom problem as this doesn't happen on clean flash. Use default themes and don't use excessive mods like xposed etc.
