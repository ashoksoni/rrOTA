Latest CM and Resurrection Remix sources synced.
Rotation vector fix.(New approach with wrapper)
KCal implementation is much clearer now, Removed not needed commits and it's only few commits now. 
Usb: Gadget: mass_storage: added sysfs entry for cdrom to LUNs (To support DriveDroid properly to switch between USB/CD-ROM)
- This commit still not making DriveDroid perfectly work on our op2 but I am discussing this issue with the dev and hopefully a perfect solution will be available by next update.

- Option to ignore slider in zen auto mode. 
- Extra notification modes (ring and vibrate).

Bugs yet to squash. (Mostly by CM or RR team)

Certain apps are not visible in "Apps with usage access" but that's Resurrection Remix issue not a local issue as reported in bacon thread too. 
FC in Privacy Guard - That's again not a rom problem as this doesn't happen on clean flash. Use default themes and don't use excessive mods like xposed etc.
